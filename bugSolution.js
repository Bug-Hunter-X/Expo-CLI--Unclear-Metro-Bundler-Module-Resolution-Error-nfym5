The solution to this elusive bug often involved a careful examination of the project's dependency tree.  In some cases, the issue stemmed from a mismatch between package versions or conflicting dependencies. I used the following strategies to resolve the issue:

1. **Dependency Audit:**  I ran `npm ls` or `yarn why <package_name>` to investigate potential version conflicts. 
2. **Cleaning the Cache:**  Thoroughly cleaned the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean`
3. **Reinstalling Dependencies:**  I removed `node_modules` and reinstalled the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. **Version Pinning:** In many instances, resolving the problem involved precise version pinning of specific packages in the `package.json` file to eliminate version incompatibilities.
5. **Import Path Verification:** I carefully checked all import paths in the project files to ensure that they were correct and resolved accurately by the Metro bundler.

If none of the above worked, I found that a full project reset (deleting the project folder and cloning it fresh) sometimes resolves more complicated issues, ensuring a clean start and avoiding any hidden corruption in the project files.
