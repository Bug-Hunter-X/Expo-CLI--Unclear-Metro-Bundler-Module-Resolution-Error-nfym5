While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the Metro bundler, specifically mentioning a problem with resolving modules or packages.  The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact cause. I tried various solutions like clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking package versions, but nothing worked. The error persisted across different platforms and emulators.
